Hi there,

I am writing to express my interest in the web scraping related job you posted. With my extensive experience as a data engineer, I am confident in my ability to effectively collect the headings of articles and store them in a well-defined structure.

I have strong background in web scraping, automation, data analysis, and data visualization, and I have been working on that for over 5 years.

My skills and expertise include:

- Proficiency in programming languages: Python and JavaScript
- Utilized Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Puppeteer
- Specialized in implementing proxy rotation techniques, overcoming captcha challenges, bypassing the cloudflare security, running scrapers using multi-threading techniques, scheduling recurring tasks, inspecting network requests, and handling dynamic websites

In order to better tailor my proposal to your needs, I have a few questions:

1. What is the source website address?
2. Is there any way to separate the headings and paragraphs on the web pages?
3. What are the time constraints for the scraper?

I am excited about the opportunity to work with you and contribute my skills to help you achieve your goals.

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Kind regards,
Eldar.
