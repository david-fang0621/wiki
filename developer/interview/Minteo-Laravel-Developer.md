### Laravel Developer / Directed Acyclic Graph Architecture

> A DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph, a type of graph whose nodes are directionally related to each other and don’t form a directional closed loop. In the practice of analytics engineering, DAGs are often used to visually represent the relationships between your data models.

While the concept of a DAG originated in mathematics and gained popularity in computational work, DAGs have found a home in the modern data world. They offer a great way to visualize data pipelines and [lineage](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/data-lineage), and they offer an easy way to understand dependencies between data models.

>

**Purpose:**
You will be responsible for developing quality, efficient, well-commented, test-driven code in PHP for the [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) distributed ledger. The role will require leveraging industry standard technologies like Lighthouse GraphQL, MySQL, Redis, and Web Sockets. You will collaborate with both band-end teams as well as client-side SDK developers, who primarily leverage JavaScript (and other languages) to communicate with the [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) ledger's GraphQL API. Additionally, the role will require building bespoke microservices to tackle external API consumption, using them to retrieve rich data from the [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) ledger or trigger new ledger events to be written. Finally, the role will also require contributing to our open-source codebases (such as the PHP [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) client SDK) and closed-source ones (such as the PHP [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) server itself).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Work with the product team to develop quality, efficient, scalable, well-commented, test-driven code in PHP for the [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) distributed ledger ecosystem.
- Collaborate with client-side SDK developers who primarily leverage JavaScript to communicate with the [Knish.IO](http://knish.io/) ledger's GraphQL API.
- Work with database queries using the Eloquent ORM as well as raw SQL code, with an eye towards security and scalability.
- Participate in code reviews and provide feedback to ensure high code quality.
- Stay up-to-date with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and trends - especially where it comes to our immediate technology stack.
- Troubleshoot and debug issues with the code and offer quick solutions to ensure optimal performance.
- Develop and maintain technical documentation.

**Required Qualifications:**

- 2+ years of experience in PHP development.
- 1+ years of experience with the Laravel framework.
- 1+ years of experience with relational databases, like MySQL or MariaDB.
- Understanding of Lighthouse GraphQL Server best practices and general conventions.
- Experience with Redis and Web Sockets.
- Proficiency in unit testing with PHPUnit or other tools, and test-driven development in general.
- Experience with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) best practices.
- Familiarity with Git and Git workflows, GitHub actions, and other dev automation tools.
- Good understanding of microservices architecture and API design.
- Understanding of cybersecurity hardening and general DevSecOps practices.
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team.
- Excellent communication skills.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

- Experience with Docker + Docker Compose, and/or Kubernetes
- Experience with JavaScript, NodeJS, and/or VueJS development.
- Familiarity with blockchain technologies and other types of distributed ledger technologies.
- Open-source contribution experience a plus.
- Experience with directed acyclic graphs, graph databases, and other non-linear data structures.
- Experience working with Debian/Ubuntu-based cloud environments on platforms like AWS, Azure, Oracle, or GCP.

## My proposal

---

I am a highly motivated and skilled Laravel backend developer with 5 years of experience building web applications and developing RESTful APIs. I am proficient in Laravel **design patterns** and writing clean, well-structured, and test-driven PHP code. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in the **Laravel ecosystem** and designing and developing web applications from scratch.

> Design patterns: MVC (model-view-controller), Service container, Facade pattern, Singleton pattern, Repository pattern

You’re looking for a full stack developer:

- Laravel web application
- NodeJS-based microservices

> Laravel ecosystem: Sanctum (Authorization), Socialite (OAuth - Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, GitHub, etc), Sail (Docker, Redis), Mix (frontend - Vue.js or React.js), Cashier (Payment gateway integration - Stripe), etc

During my time at **Dynamic Megasoft Limited** over the past 5 years, I have developed 7+ web applications in various sectors such as eCommerce, Fitness, and Consultancy. In addition, I have been involved in developing an ERP system that includes Inventory, Accounting, CRM, CMS, and POS. These projects were built using Laravel for the back-end and Vue.js for the front-end. They also feature real-time communication using websockets, task scheduling and queuing, and in-memory caching using Redis.

Here are some examples of my work:

- https://abcmatteservice.no/ (eCommerce)
- https://optimalstrengthgains.com/ (Fitness)
- https://staging.gotoconsult.com/ (Consultancy)

I strongly believe that I am a good match for this job position. Thank you.
Lastly, it’s not allowed to share the contact information (like email, phone) on Upwork as you know. And I will send my resume after this meeting.
