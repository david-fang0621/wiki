## My experiences and skills

Hi Devin,
I hope you are doing well.

I am Fang from China, a technology enthusiast with a fascination for linguistics and cognitive science. Whenever I'm tackling a new task, be it in my everyday life or at work, I'm always trying to apply my technical skills in order to attain a quick, easy and elegant solution.

Code quality is very important to me, even in my personal projects I try my best to follow the best practices of the specific tool I'm using, along with minimal design principles and TDD.

I'm a quick learner and I love playing with the new shiny toys of the tech world. When given the choice, I prefer using the most suitable technology that best fits my problem, over another technology I'm more comfortable with but that isn't optimal.

My main focuses are in Web Development with ReactJS and NodeJS.

**Technical domain:**

- Web & mobile application development
- Web scraping & data science
- DevOps
- Desktop application development

**Specialties:**

- FrontEnd: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Angualr, Vue, Jquery
- BackEnd: PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Python Django
- Git, Docker, Continuous Integration (TeamCity)
- Relational Databases, SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- Agile Development, Scrum
- blockchain & ethereum

**Professional experience:**

- Comprehensive understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle
- Requirement Analysis
- Strong analytic skills
- Expertise in functional testing
- Effective communication with Clients

Best regards,
Fang.
