Firstly, let me introduce myself. I am Ivan Ovcharenko from Ukraine.

I have been working for over 3 years in the IT industries as full-stack developer. Mainly worked on the web & mobile related projects and achived all the stages of full stack development lifecycle including the problem solving, data structure and algorithms, Vanila JavaScript, Typescript, React, React Native, Node, and so on.

I was first exposed to the basics of programming at the University with my first exposure consisting of simple Object oriented programming concepts for howwork.

Currently working at mobile and web development on Skelia company located on here as part time and nowadays I am focusing on the freelancer work. I love to work on projects where I can utilize my skills, in particular, React and React Native.
