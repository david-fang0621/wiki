Hello Shiva,

I came across your job posting and believe I am a great fit for the role. I have over 7 years of experience in web and mobile app development, specializing in MERN stack, JAM stack, and TALL stack. Through utilizing the microservices concept, I have developed REST and GraphQL APIs, which has allowed me to successfully complete projects for a variety of companies.

My main focus has been on healthcare, eCommerce, and car marketplace projects, where I have been responsible for the development of CRM and CMS systems. In addition, I have completed several side projects in the Blockchain field, including Dapps development on Ethereum and Solana, Cryptocurrency exchange platform integration (Kraken, Binance API), and NFT marketplace development on the Ethereum network.

Given my experience in web technologies and Blockchain, I believe I could be of great assistance to you. If you think this could work, I would be more than happy to provide you with my detailed resume and application.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Warm regards,
