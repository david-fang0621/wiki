### Blockchain General

Dear Client

I want to start by saying thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal.

Those years have allowed me to build skills as a full-stack developer, specializing in writing smart contracts for DeFis and dApps as well as full-stack web development through the use of JavaScript frameworks (especially blockchain-based applications).
My blockchain experience is extensive, having worked with blockchain since 2016. I have built DeFis, Dapps, and NFT minting projects and worked with smart contracts in Solidity.
We have also built and deployed many marketplaces using tokens such as NFT-20, NFT-721, and NFT-1155, etc.

I have a genuine passion for my work, and love being able to use that passion to create original, creative projects for my clients.
I am ready to start from today to develop your product as per your requirements.
I understand that you might just look for an expert team of developers who can work with you closely to deliver a perfect end product to you.
Hope you are searching for a company that works on the principle of creativity and innovation.
As development can be done by anyone but done with the most creativity is with few.
And fortunately, I have completed a similar project for another client recently so that I feel confident about this project and I think that I'm the right person for this work because I have many good projects that I have accomplished.

I am an individual freelancer and I am available to work on your project full time.
Iâ€™ll happily sit down and work with you to build the best possible plan of attack to create and perfect your vision!

Thank you very much.
