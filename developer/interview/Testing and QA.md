Describe testing and QA

I always apply best practices to test and improve quality assurance, continuously striving for improvement.

1. Develop a comprehensive test plan.
2. Use automated testing tools to speed up and streamline your testing process.
3. Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery to reduce the time between development and deployment.
4. Utilize separate development, staging, and production environments to ensure a smooth deployment process.
5. Gather feedback from clients through surveys or by monitoring user behavior with analytics tools.
6. Monitor and analyze data using logs, error tracking, and performance monitoring tools.
