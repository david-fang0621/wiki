### Upwork Account Rent Proposal

---

Thanks for your reply.

As you know, I am a software engineer and have strong ability to develop web and mobile app. But it's difficult to get jobs from my location nowadays. So I want to change my business strategy. If you are located on United States, then you can create an account on Upwork and get jobs from there. Upwork supports "US only" projects and those projects has large budget. So you can get potential clients and I can work on tasks you give me from those clients.

Remind that "US only" projects has normally 50 - 90 USD as hourly basis. My hourly rate is 25 -30 USD according to the projects. So if you get projects with $50 of value from Upwork, then you can earn $2000 and $1000 as your earnings. Once the Upwork account has more work history, then you can get more large of projects, and it makes more earning to us.

Also, if you have no enough to send the proposals on Upwork, then I can do it instead of you through AnyDesk or TeamViewer. Upwork has the features that anyone can't access to setting page without security question, so I can't process or do anything like password change, payment withdraw, and another security options. So it's safe for you in this case as well.

There are lots of examples nearby me. My colleagues are earning 10k ~ 20k monthly from their partner's Upwork accounts.

I think that you have an overview of my suggestion and would help me as much as possible, and I want to create a startup with you after we have experience on Upwork.

Looking forward to your reply.

Thanks again.
