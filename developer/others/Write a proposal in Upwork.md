   Reply to this message and let me know when would be a good time for us to connect this week.

I hvae a couple more ideas I could share as well. When is the best time for us to connect this week?

Are you free Wednesday or Thursday to talk briefly? Let me know what works best for you.

- ** Mistakes to AVOID in proposal \***

1. without enough spacing
2. cut & paste the same proposal
3. background & introduction too much

- ** The case what you are not sure with the cost and timeline. \***
  P.S. - the proposed cost is an estimate. I could give you an exact figure, timeframe and what I expect to be able to accomplish if we talk. If any of the above sounds interesting, reply to this and we'll set up a time to talk this week.
- ** Tip \***

1. Use the first line to show that you’ve read their profile and understand what they need (instead of saying your name and talking about yourself).
2. Introduce yourself and explain why you’re an expert in what they need.
3. Make a recommendation or ask a question to reinforce the fact that you’re an expert in this topic.
4. Close with a Call to Action to get them to reply. Either ask for a website to learn more, or ask them when they’re available to talk.
5. Sign off with your name.
6. Keep everything brief. Aim for less than 120 words in your Upwork proposal. 85-100 words is ideal.
7. Use great spacing; you should only have two to three sentences MAXIMUM per paragraph in your proposal.
8. Only send proposals for jobs posted on Upwork within the last 24 hours. You’ll be more likely to get the interview if you do this.
9. Commit to sending out proposals five days per week (Monday – Friday) for at least a month to build up your leads on Upwork.
10. Price yourself near the top of the client’s range. Never compete on price and never try to be the cheapest.
11. Make sure you have a great Upwork profile that backs up everything you’re saying in your Upwork proposal.

  Hi there,

I just read your posting. It sounds like you need an expert in cold emails to advise you on everything from the content to the overall strategy.

I have a background in email marketing and have been doing this for 3 years. Cold emailing in B2B is what I specialize in.

I can work with you to write the content and subject lines, recommend the best technologies for you to use, and more. Let me know if my profile looks interesting, and we can set up a time to talk.

Best regards.
