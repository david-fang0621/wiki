We want to create a "new" page that people will see directly after they create an account through whatever of the 4 methods we provide.

I did a raw sketch of what it could look like. Would still need a headline like "Choose what you are looking for". Should be responsive so that all devices can use that page properly. That is btw a general task we want to take on with you step by step for different things.

These pictures are meant to probably be implemented into the product panels of the respective product. You can take a look when incognito on the [pracc.com](http://pracc.com/) landingpage, there we have something similar in the bottom to showcase the products.
