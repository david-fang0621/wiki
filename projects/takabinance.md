ðŸ”· **Simple React front-end with optional Python back-end**

Hi. I've attached some initial requirements for a web app with a Python backend. I can do the backend or you can. I don't mind.

If this first phase goes well, we can look at adding more functionality.

I'd prefer React, but an open to other frameworks if you're more comfortable.

The attached spec is quick and dirty so I'm sure I forgot some things, but it should get the basic concept across.

Thanks!
