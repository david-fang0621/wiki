## Draft Specification

basically I need a "Annual Activity Planner" made according to mockups. It allows users who are heads of departments have to itemize what they want in their plan.

Every department also has a point value. Every item will have an evaluation question with a point value. (Values will vary and departments will set the value)

Example:
Department of Sports (60 points)
Mandate:

1. Provide training (20 points)
   1a) arrange practice sessions
   1b) arrange 1on1 training
2. Book gyms (20 points)
3. Arrange competions in February (20 points)

Questions:
Were practice sessions held?
Were 1 on 1 sessions held?
How many gyms were booked?
How many competions were arranged in February?

Teams will be asked these questions every months via a form.

The system will calculate how many points are earned per questions per department per month.

Entire plan, with point values and questions must be approved every year. If some needs to be added mid year, the it has to be approved aswell
